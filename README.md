# Arduino-Game-ENGR-103
Repository holding code for a reaction-based game for the Adafruit CPX board. Created as part of assignment for ENGR 103 at OSU.

## Rules

When starting the game you will see one led that is red or blue, and a white led swinging back and forth around the board. You must click the corresponding button while the white light is on the colored light. If the light is red click the right button, otherwise click the left button. If you succeed the speed will increase, but if you fail the speed restarts to the base.
